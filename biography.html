		<h3>"Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers. It may <br>not be difficult to store up in the mind a vast <br>quantity of facts within a comparatively short time, <br> but the ability to form judgments requires the severe <br>discipline of hard work and the tempering heat of <br>experience and maturity."<br>Calvin Coolidge</h3>
